# GesttureRecognizer

Tested on Pixel 3 (API 30), Android Studio 4.1.2

Users can add gestures in the addition panel by first drawing a gesture and then enter the gesture name in an alert dialogue that pops up.

Users can manage and view their library of added gestures in the library panel. Gestures in the library are provided in a list view and each gesture has its own delete and edit buttons.

The delete button removes the gesture from the library ans the edit button brings up a popup similar to gesture addition.

Users can draw gestures in the home/recognition panel and obtain there top three matched gestures
